# Artwork-API-Search
Using 6 Web APIs to create a dynamic search list of artwork photos asynchronously. 
Using asynchronous fetching and promises techniques, pulling from 5 JSON data apis to generate select lists that change on event input. 
And an Image API url-string to pull images.

In this project I use Promise.all() to perform 4 asynchronous fetches at once, and destructure them into their own data arrays for further processing.
Used advanced loop and array method techniques to implement DOM markup.
